# The StackSmith â€“ DevOps Architecture Blueprint

This is a reference system design built for lean, high-growth SaaS teams.

No fluff. No chaos. Just calm infrastructure that scales cleanly.

---

## ðŸ”§ Core Philosophy

- **CI/CD should be invisible** â€“ deploys run cleanly, errors surface fast  
- **Infrastructure is code** â€“ Terraform, versioned, auditable  
- **Cloud is modular** â€“ AWS/GCP with clear roles, minimal sprawl  
- **Monitoring is quiet** â€“ alerts when needed, silence otherwise

---

## ðŸ§± Stack Overview

- GitHub Actions or Jenkins for CI/CD  
- Terraform for infrastructure-as-code  
- Docker + ECS/GKE for containerized services
- AWS (or GCP) for scalable cloud foundation
- Frontend, Backend or Full-Stack
